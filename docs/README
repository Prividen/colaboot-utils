CoLaBoot (Compressed Layers Boot) is a boot system that allow you to mount root
FS as OverlayFS from a separate layers, each of them is compressed squashfs image.

Kernel modules, required for boot (e.g. network modules) may be added to initrd
or provided as a separate initramfs image. All other modules may be provided as
one of the layers.

There are two scripts in this package that helps to prepare CoLaBoot images:
- docker2squash - prepare squashfs image from Docker object (image or container);
- modlist2image - prepare squashfs or cpio image with kernel modules, based on
  list-of-modules file. Cpio images may be linked to initrd during boot, and
  squashfs images may be loaded as one of the CoLaBoot layers.


Also please look on examples of .modlist and docker-make files.
