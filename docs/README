CoLaBoot (Compressed Layers Boot, CLB) is a boot system that mount rootfs as
OverlayFS from separate layers, each of them is compressed squashfs image.

Kernel modules, required for boot, must be provided as a separate initramfs
image. These boot modules can be a drivers for network cards, disk devices, file
systems, etc.

Any other modules for your system should be provided as a SquashFS layer(s), or
be embedded into the only layer that you have.

SquashFS layers can be pre-existent images (e.g. from distributive ISO -
live, rescue), or you can prepare them manually, by compressing required
directories (e.g. /lib/firmware), or it can be obtained from Docker object
(container or image).

There are two scripts in this package that helps to prepare squashfs layers and
module images:
- docker2squash - prepare squashfs layer image from Docker object (image or container);
- modlist2image - prepare squashfs or cpio image with kernel modules, based on
  list-of-modules (.modlist) file. Cpio images can be linked to initrd during
  boot, and squashfs images can be loaded as one of the CoLaBoot layers.

Also please look on examples of .modlist and docker-make files.
